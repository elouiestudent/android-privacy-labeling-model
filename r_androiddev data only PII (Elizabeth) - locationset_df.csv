Do you think that site really has their own weather service? Does someone gather the weather for the day in every area and deliver it to those users? No. They use yahoo or other weather service and instead of using it like a normal dev would, to display all relevant information in a detailed method, they went for a simplistic/comical approach and instead deliver the weather in a clever text based manner. These apps are nice because they do not require many API calls to the parent library and they are just one simple API call to usually get a random (or a randomizer method if the API doesnt support calling for a random entry) and display only one result in a pretty way.

* Does a typical Android dev working in the industry use Eclipse primarily? Are there other staple softwares I need to know about?
* Should I beeline towards Java as my go to language?
* What are some mistakes new Android devs often make?

My goal is to get working in the industry, as much as I enjoy being a game dev the jobs just aren't available in my location. Android dev and iOS dev jobs are however in high-demand. (I intend to learn iOS dev once I've mastered Android dev).

My current plan is to do this XDADevelopers course on YouTube, and then perhaps find a Java course, is this a wise course of action?

The reason it is so important to make use of platform design standards is that you can build an instantly familiar UI by re-using familiar design components. This drastically lowers the learning curve when a user first opens the app. Most Android users are familiar with the hamburger navigation and how it works. You tap the hamburger icon, and out pops a menu that overlays your content. If I saw a menu that pushed my content to the left - it would make me uncomfortable, because I am not used to that.

By re-using familiar design components, you get the UI out of the way. When users do not notice your UI design choices, it's a good thing.

Let's say you drive a car that has the parking brake near the center console. This is what you are used to. Imagine you got into your friends car, and the parking brake is in a different location. Maybe under the steering wheel, or a button on the door. You would be annoyed, because you cannot find it immediately, because it is not where you'd expect. 

When designing a UI, do not force the user to learn something new when you do not have to. As material design proliferates, more users will come to expect it. By designing your app based on material design - you are making it easier for your users to navigate around your app.",0

At the moment, the developers of the application I work on receive stack traces in two ways:

1. **Application crashes in the wild:** For this, we use Crashlytics and their Gradle task silently uploads the mapping file, which makes the use of ProGuard transparent from the dev point of view. Should the mapping file upload fail (it happens once in a blue moon), you will need your mapping file to make your stack traces useful.

2. **User submitted bugs:** Our users are capable of reporting issues to us via email, which will automatically add an internal log file of everything the user has done over the last little while. This file does require de-obfuscation, and this is where we actually need the mapping file.

Our team uses git tags for the purposes of cutting releases, and we have a set of scripts that we use for automating our build process: incrementing the version code/name, assembling the release build, copying the newly-generated mapping file to a git-tracked location, committing the updated version and mapping file to version control, tagging it with the specified release name, and pushing the commit and tag.",0

8101,location,"Hi GrandAdmiralDan,
Well, I’m happy to hear you guys are working on this. And I’m really happy to hear ICU will become public API.
But frankly, considering we are 8 years into Android and you are only starting to fix this now, still doesn’t really reflect well. 

I know it is easy to workaround the NDK to get Lua built, but for my time constraints and audience background, it is reflective of the types of problems we developers still fight on a regular basis. Lua is the easiest to deal with, but there are many more which are much more painful and time consuming. 

I could have gotten into how the newer NDK API levels removed a few things which prevented ICU from building. Or the problems and bugs I encountered trying to build Swift on Android with different API versions. Or I could have gotten into other never fixed roadblocking bugs like the infamous bug 3434. And I didn’t talk about Android fragmentation and the fact is that over 1/4 is still pre-API 21. (And a stdio deadlocking bug in 5.0 which affects Swift so 5.1 is the minimum instead of 5.0, losing nearly another 10% of the current available devices.) Even with your changes that may be coming in a few years, we still have to add extra years on top of that before we can use them.


But here’s a another problem I’m facing maybe you can help with. As I said in the talk, I am adding CMake support for Swift. I also said Android is officially adding CMake support. However, for time, what I did not say is that there is a new hell that has been created because there are now 3 major CMake toolchains now competing with each other, and all are incompatible. There is the OpenCV toolchain which everybody has forked from for the past many years (including me), the official CMake just added Android support, and you guys have your own fork which is incompatible with both of them and is stuck on an old CMake 3.6 (CMake is now on 3.8).

I just posted to the NDK mailing list asking about how I can leverage yours, but I need to be able to merge in my changes and invoke CMake sitting in a different location than yours. But so far, the answer seems to be that I can’t do this, and your CMake source is not something I can pull and merge with. But no answer from the person who would know for sure. Maybe you can find out how to make this possible get your CMake git repo published.


I also want to point out that I’m am seriously disappointed that you guys didn’t add Android Studio project generation to your CMake implementation, so you still need to have both an Android Studio project and a CMake description. (And I am still uncovering a lot of limitations.) This is just one more of those time sucking things that makes it so unpleasant to support Android. This is one of things I implemented for Blurrr to solve for other people, but is a PITA to maintain. You guys implementing this, maintaining it, and contributing it back to CMake would be actually really valuable to the world.

One more thing. As you fix the C++ side of the NDK, please don’t forget C. Maybe it’s just me, but I’m getting this overall vibe that the NDK team may still be thinking of C support as a second class citizen. I’m seeing this in Android Studio as there are things explicitly labeled C++, even when I’m only dealing with C. Back to the one of the premises of the talk, C is one of the most important foundational things that everything else can stand on.

2257,location,"We am a start-up with 500k investment and our app was suspended and removed from Google Play! Help us please: 

Hi people!

Our app was suspended from Google Play after one major update.

After appeal we received this e-mail from Google:

Hi developer,

Thanks for contacting Google Play team. 

**Status of app: Suspended from Google Play due to policy violation**

I’ve reviewed your appeal request and found that your app violates the **Malicious Behavior** policy. We don’t allow apps that steal data, secretly monitor or harm users, or are otherwise malicious. We have determined that your app is being promoted as a means of carrying out spying or secret surveillance of others.

Surveillance and ""Commercial Spyware"" are explicitly prohibited on Google Play. Only policy compliant apps exclusively designed and marketed for parental (including family) monitoring or enterprise management may distribute on the Store with tracking and reporting features, provided they fully comply with the requirements described below:

Qualified apps that monitor or track a user’s behavior on a device must comply with these requirements:

* Apps must not present themselves as a spying or secret surveillance solution.
* Apps must not hide or cloak tracking behavior or attempt to mislead users about such functionality.
* Present users with a persistent notification and unique icon that clearly identifies the app.
* Apps and app listings on Google Play must not provide any means to activate or access functionality that violate these terms, such as linking to a non-compliant APK hosted outside Google Play.
* You are solely responsible for determining the legality of your app in its targeted locale. Apps determined to be unlawful in locations where they are published will be removed.

You can read through the Malicious Behavior policy page for more details. 

For example, your app currently is not exclusively designed and marketed for parental (including family) monitoring or enterprise management may distribute on the Store with tracking and reporting features.

Please note that suspensions count as strikes against the good standing of your Google Play Developer account. Egregious or multiple policy violations can result in suspension, as can repeated app rejections or removals.

If your developer credentials are still in good standing with Google Play and if your app allows for it, you can publish a new compliant version of the app by following these steps:

1. Make the necessary changes to your app to address the issue described above, if possible.
2. Double check that your app complies with all other Developer Program Policies. Additional enforcement could occur if there are further policy violations.
3. Sign in to your Play Console and upload a new app using a new package name and a new app name.

Please let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks for your continued support of Google Play.

Hello Jay,

Thanks for notifying us and helping us better understand our app's problems.

We would like to mention that this application is of a major importance for our team as it has been developed with the contribution of investors funds, our whole team efforts and user's feedback and involvement alike. Therefore - we would like to do whatever necessary to keep our App Name and branding. Submitting our app with a different name would mean changing our business entirely.

We now realise the severity of our breach of conduit. We are extremely sorry and we would like to be given the opportunity to take all the necessary measures to fix this and make sure this won't repeat in the future.

That being said, we would like to be able to upload a new, complaint version of our app, with the following changes:

\- remove all the location tracking related texts (including our site and Play Store) and stop presenting ourselves as a spying or secret surveillance solution.

\- make the necessary changes to our app to only allow location sharing between specific users, with their explicit permission and for a limited time only.

Please let us know if there is anything else we can do so we can reach an agreement and have our application available again for our users.

Thank you for your consideration and for helping our team continue offering the services our users love!

I have a few questions though:

What software should I have my cousin use for design and any extra tools like those touch pens?
Do you think I can create a decent app within 3 months or so considering I am a novice?
Should the app use Google maps to find the stores and how would I ""filter"" out the right one?

Seeing this is an educational project free to use, i believe that restriction doesn't apply to you. (See Google Maps Terms Section 10.4.c.iv) 

But my advice to you would be to track the user positions on the phone and build a .KML file of the ""recording"" session. This file can later be uploaded to a server when a data connection is available or shared to your contacts via intents through mail, instant messaging or whatever. Then, the user contacts or the user himself can load this kml on Google Earth or Google My Maps to see the location path. This way you don't need to bother with Google Maps API license at all, and only set up a simple server to store those kml files (if you really want to store them).",1

1504,location,"Looking for advice on how to integrate Google Play Services location SettingsAPI with MVP architecture:Hey /r/androiddev,

I have an MVP architecture app that utilizes Google Play Services, Dagger 2, and RxJava but I'm having a hard time integrating Google's APIs into MVP. It seems like many of Google's APIs lend themselves to tons of logic inside of Activities (Which goes against single responsibility principle and MVP).

I have a screen that needs to access the phone's location so I'm checking if location settings are enabled in my presenter. To do this, I've written a reactive wrapper around Google Play Services Location so my presenter delegates to `LocationInteractor` which calls into Google Play Services.

To check if location settings are enabled you need to call into Google's SettingsAPI,  jump through a ton of hoops and callbacks, and eventually get back a `LocationSettingsResult` object. Fine. To get the status of the settings you need to call `locationSettingsResult.getStatus()` and check if the `status.getStatusCode()` is equal to either `LocationSettingsStatusCodes.SUCCESS`, `LocationSettingsStatusCodes.RESOLUTION_REQUIRED`, or `LocationSettingsStatusCodes.SETTINGS_CHANGE_UNAVAILABLE`. If the status code is `RESOLUTION_REQUIRED`, then calling `status.startResolutionForResult(Activity activity, int requestCode)` will open this wonderful dialog prompting the user to enable location services. 

Ok. So my `LocationInteractor` takes care of this and returns a `Status` object from Google Play Services:
`public Single&lt;Status&gt; getLocationSettingStatus(){...}`All fine and dandy. Since opening this dialog requires an Activity, I'm having my presenter call back to the view with this `Status` object:
    
    // Inside of some presenter method
    locationInteractor.getLocationSettingStatus()
                            .subscribe(status -&gt; {
                                if (status.getStatusCode() == LocationSettingsStatusCodes.SUCCESS) {
                                    doSomethingThatRequiresLocation();
                                } else if (status.getStatusCode() == LocationSettingsStatusCodes.RESOLUTION_REQUIRED) {
                                    if (isViewAttached()) {
                                        view.showDialog(status);
                                    }
                                } else {
                                    if (isViewAttached()) {
                                        view.onErrorNoLocation();
                                    }
                                }
                            }, throwable -&gt; {
                                if (isViewAttached()) {
                                    view.onErrorNoLocation();
                                }
                            });
The View's `showDialog` method looks like this:

    @Override
        public void showDialog(Status status) {
            try {
                status.startResolutionForResult(this, 0);
            } catch (IntentSender.SendIntentException e) {
                onErrorLocation();
            }
        }

However, this still isn't enough! You need to catch the result of this dialog in `onActivityResult`!!

     @Override
        public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
            switch (requestCode) {
                case 0:
                    switch (resultCode) {
                        case Activity.RESULT_OK:
                            // Call to presenter
                            // Location settings now enabled
                            break;
    
                        case Activity.RESULT_CANCELED:
                            // Location settings still disabled
                            onErrorLocation();
                            break;
                    }
                    break;
            }
        }

I really really hate all this boilerplate. Every place that I want to check for location settings I am going to need to add this boilerplate in my presenter and views. This is a lot of code to be copying around! Furthermore, the `Status` object is final which makes it super hard to mock it during tests of my presenter.  

Does anyone know a better way of interacting with this API in an MVP context?

Although I really love how this dialog window will automatically enable location services, I am thinking about ditching Google's SettingsAPI since it is such a PITA to use. I'd rather open a custom dialog that has a button which opens the phone location settings. It won't be automatic like the SettingsAPI, but it will fit into my architecture, be easier to use, and be easy to test.

**Should I deal with all this Google Play Services boilerplate or just roll my own dialog which will obey MVP principles?**

Sorry for the wall of text I really needed to rant about this API.

IMO you really should be setting some kind of ""connected"" listener on `library` and only call `doSomething()` when that happens. This is similar to how you have to connect a `GoogleApiClient` before you can get the phone's location with `FusedLocationProviderApi` that uses the api client. Short answer, I don't think you should do anything differently on the Dagger side.

The Android SDK offers two intents to exclude an app from power saver restrictions:

ACTION\_REQUEST\_IGNORE\_BATTERY\_OPTIMIZATIONS is user\-friendly, but not available on many devices from what I see, and legal only for certain use cases, not currently for location use cases.

ACTION\_IGNORE\_BATTERY\_OPTIMIZATION\_SETTINGS is not user\-friendly, but available on more devices, and has no restriction in terms of legal use cases. I don't consider it suitable for regular users, though, just power users. On stock Android it takes the user to a screen listing apps that are currently excluded from power saver; the user has to find the option to show all apps on the device, and then sift through the list of 100\+ more\-or\-less obscure apps to find the desired app. This won't work for a majority of users IMO.

I wonder if that kind of watchdog that you mention can be made reliable. The system may pretend that you're getting location data, but instead feed you stale data. \(User not moving.\) You could create your own AI to battle Google's AI...

1. My app manages a set of data and there is an import section that can potentially take long to execute, since for every entry a different rest request needs to be performed. So I though about doing this the same way imgur does with image uploading: Triggering some kind of background execution that displays its progress in a notification and lets you know when its done. You can still use the app in the meantime and if you go to the import section you can also see the progress of the task being executed.
2. I need to know the location of the user (provided they gave permission) in many points through the app. I got a library that handles location requests through RxJava and it works nicely, also lets me subscribe to periodic updates in the form of an Observable. However this means i need to subscribe again from every activity / screen. So i thought maybe there is a way to request updates constantly while the app is open and launch a broadcast message to whoever is listening to let them know of the new data. 

I started digging up a bit online to see how to accomplish these two tasks but I got quickly overwhelmed by old and new documentation talking about many different solutions such as JobIntents, JobSchedulers, Services, Background &amp; Foreground Services, IntentServices, WorkManagers, AlarmManagers...

It's my understanding that product flavors will still make use of anything inside of /main that isn't overridden in the product flavor's directory. Am I wrong about this, or am I doing something else wrong? How should my product flavors be importing shared code? The locationTracking and nonLocationTracking product flavor directories are currently empty.. Only thing I changed was adding the product flavors in the build.gradle file and then creating the directories for each product flavor as siblings of /main. Any help would be extremely appreciated!

They change default behaviour when they feel like there is a privacy (or related) issue that needs to be fixed asap. If you don't do that, apps just dont target Q and call it a day: see how many apps still target &lt;23? Well, enough for them to force those apps to display a revokable list of permissions on start.
Sure the play store forces it but what about apps that will not be updated? What about apps distributed outside of the store?

The API itself then stays bug compatible. But if they want to change how the OS fundamentally works, they'll break apps. Storage and clipboard access bring huge problems.

 PWA, Progressive web apps, are websites that you can ""install"" on your mobile phones and users won't know they're not an app. If your app doesn't have a lot of stuff that requires really high performance, you're just displaying data, then that would be my vote.

If the consent library is generic, it can request the appropriate info from the server based on location, IP address, etc., and display it to the user, instead of updating it every time a new region gets a new law/regulation. Once you update to this generic version, you don't need to worry anymore, as the configuration would live online (and possibly cached locally too).",1

It's my first time making a game of any sort (I've previously stuck to utility apps on Android), and I was wondering how I did! Here's the play store description:

EarthGuesser is an educational puzzle game that takes you to a random Google Street View location around the world and challenges you to guess its location on a map. From the most remote roads in the Amazon to crowded shopping malls and museums, the game trains your awareness of surroundings while offering you breathtaking views.

299,locations,"Having trouble finding information on location handling/directions and getting a list of nearby locations.:Hey /r/androiddev!  I'm working on a project which includes the replication of parts of the ""local"" app.  I'm not sure if that is a staple across many phones but basically what it does is give you a list of nearby places given your filters and you can tap to get options like map/directions to/or to call them. I suppose that is just about exactly what I need, except I need the list of places to come from my own database.  

Now I've done a bit of digging and couldn't find a way to do directions properly (most resources said that since there is no API you need to handle all cases?)  In addition to that, directions seem to need longitude/latitude instead of an address which isn't optimal.  I'd also need to find distances between multiple locations and the user location and sort them based on that distance.  The sorting should be easy, but I don't know of a best practice way to request so many distances as to do that in real time and I'm not sure if carriers put a restriction/fee in place for spamming through gps.  I suppose I could just do some Pythagorean theorem lovelyness and calculate distance that way... but I'm not sure if users expect as the crow flies distance or road based.

I don't know if I'm looking in the wrong places or searching the wrong terms, but if anyone could lend me a hand I'm be most appreciative.  I'll keep you guys up to date with whatever implementations I find on my own in the mean time.

Thanks!

TL;DR - Having trouble finding a way to do directions with address, launching to directions, and finding distances to nearby places.


EDIT:

After digging around for a bit and testing things I found, I discovered how to convert lat/long to an address.  [Here] (http://developer.android.com/training/basics/location/geocoding.html) is the tutorial I found that I used.  If you get a ""cannot connect to service"" error while using geocoder, it appears the only fix is to actually restart your phone, sadly.",1
8466,locations,"In our app, we're requesting location-updates from the FusedLocationApi with an interval of 120 seconds. You're supposed to disconnect the api from context to prevent leaks.

We're sending the locations to the server via webcalls and this shouldn't happen more than once every 120 seconds.

The issue is that we have multiple activities and in case you start one and get back to the original activity too quickly, the location-updates start right away, which means you get more than 1 update within 120 seconds.

Is there a graceful way to handle for the api to pick up where it left off?",1
1781,locations,"Bus tracking app?:Hello 

I'm kind of new to the whole development scene and was wondering how I'd go about building an app like the one in question? 

I already started an android course but i want to have a sneak peek on how i can achieve my target idea in the end. 

I want to build a bus tracking app for a local school where each parent would have a username and password that would allow them to track only the bus their child is on. I'll be using a mobile phone as the tracker. 

From what I understand, i need to send the instantaneous location of the tracker phone to a server then have the parent's app only access the locations after supplying the username and password. 

How do I get the device to send its location and how do I get the parent's app to view the location as it moves? I was hoping I'd have something similar to how the uber app or whatsapp live location works. 

I searched online and found the google maps api. However, a friend was telling me that he thinks I don't need all that (especially that it's extremely expensive for me as i live in Egypt). He says i can get the device to send its location without the need of any api whatsoever, and then I just need to get the coordinates off the server and onto the map. 

I know Google offers an asset tracking option with their premium maps api but that seems to be for $10k a year and only for a hundred vehicles. 

Thank you in advance and sorry if this is a noob question.",1

Just keep track of their gps locations and actions performed during their offline status basically.. then as soon as they get back online send a compressed copy of it back to the servers.

115,locations,"[App Request]  device radar/mapping app:I had this idea a while ago and have yet to see someone execute it.  What I'd like is an app that broadcasts the gps coordinates of one device to another over wifi and/or bluetooth.  The receiving device would then take the gps coordinates and overlay them on a map of the area. 
It would look similar to the radar used in first person shooters,  perhaps even using the compass to orient their locations relative to yours.  You'd be limited to the distance of your wifi connection,  but perhaps you could use some type of mesh network to cover more area as you add additional devices.

I'd like it to work in areas without data connection since some of the devices i'd be using are old and no longer have a cell plan associated with them.
