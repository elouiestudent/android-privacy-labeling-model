860,camera,"My experiences developing on Android:I just finished writing my second app on Android and thought I'd share my experiences &amp; thoughts.  Before Android, I had a .Net (C#) background.  I was a Dev for 5 years before quitting my job earlier this year to pursue entrepreneurship.Biggest lessons I learned:- Make use of popular frameworks/libraries.  Android requires lots of boiler plate code to get simple things done and libraries will make it quicker for you to finish an app.  For my app I used OkHttp, Dagger, Otto, Gson, to name a few.Square has a repository of well-tested Android libraries.Some sites like Appbrain also list the most popular android libraries/frameworks being used, which can give you ideas on new libraries to check out.- If you need to persist data through SQL, consider using an ORM library like OrmLite.  In my case I decided to implement content providers myself, but in the end it was a lot of boiler plate code to write (I had several tables and 6+ content providers to maintain).  Knowing how to implement content providers yourself is useful, but for my next project I'll definitely be going with a library to avoid having to write so much boiler plate code.- Learn how to write performant and memory efficient list views.  It took a while to wrap my head around how android listview adapters handle virtualization (it is quite low level), but I've come to appreciate the control it gives you.  For example, when using a CursorAdapter with a content provider I can load just the data I need to render into memory, then render that data.  So even if my content provider points to a table with 10,000 rows, if my view only fits 10 items at a time, I only load 10 rows out of the table and render that 10.  With a standard ArrayAdapter, you'd need to load all 10,000 items into memory first, before having the listview adapter filter down to show 10.- Learn how fragments work and code your app with fragments.  This will help alot with code re-use across your activities, moving layouts around (if your designer likes to change their mind often), and later on when you want to target tablets.- Install some crash monitoring service such as Crashlytics/Bugsense.  They can help you catch crashes quickly, but more importantly, you can log handled exceptions so that you can fail gracefully but still log the issue to the server for debugging.  This has helped me alot in tracking down fragmentation issues.- Become familiar with Maven repository.  Whenever searching up dependencies, this is usually my first stop.  Instead of having to find the jar to download and import, your IDE can download the dependency from Maven.- Be prepared to hit fragmentation issues if your app has dependencies on hardware/carrier specific features (i.e. Camera, Sms/Mms).  I think Android fragmentation isn't that bad if you aren't targetting these.In terms of my biggest frustration with Android so far, it would have to be the lack of a standard design pattern (MVC, MVVM, MVP, etc.) supported by the platform.  It seems like MVC and MVP are some of the more popular ones the community suggests but I haven't found any popular/well-supported libraries for them yet, so I wrote my own, which lead to lots of boilerplate code.Here are the two apps I wrote recently which are on the play store:Comet Messenger - a quick way to get your friends' opinions in group chat (US and Canada only)MSP - A simple stock tracker &amp; widget (Only in countries where Google Finance is supported)Edit: Also feel free to give feedback on the apps!",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5001,camera,"&gt; The question is why do we need OS updates if all features Because it's not *features* that are being talked about really.The core features of the OS are things like: battery management, GPU drivers, camera drivers, etc  Plus settings screens, lock screens, notification systems, etc.Those can practically only be done with an OS upgrade - meaning an install of Android 5.0.These support library, put simply, is only about the visual interface - it isn't really adding any ""features"", it's adding only some new screen layouts, animations, and menu items.There are a pretty large number of people in this Android community that seem extremely concerned about the façade of apps.  Apple and the Apple marketplace is way more concerned with cosmetic beauty - so I guess it's some kind of Android fanboi inferiority complex to constantly criticize the colors and themes of Android apps ;)It also seems to be overlooked that Android is a global phone much more than Apple.

6334,camera,"I saw your other comment saying you used Nova so you might be aware of some of these (or just know it works in Nova and not other launchers). Here's some off the top of my head.* Touch events go right through the lockscreen for a few seconds after screen off and to the app underneath (generally the Launcher) when pin/fingerprint is enabled. This causes seemingly random apps to launch when putting the phone in your pocket. Nova (beta) detects and discards these touch events.* Historically Samsung made the system Direct Dial shortcuts only work with their Launcher, and launchers need to use hacks to make them work* Then on the SGS6 and Note5 they removed the shortcut completely (even from their Launcher, go figure). Nova adds it back as we got a ton of bug reports about it missing.* They broke GET_CONTENT so it won't use the modern document chooser app. Nova uses this for restoring backups and picking images, and has to resort to a hack.* Another commenter mentioned that the camera apps forces their app to layout in landscape, what I was seeing was a portrait layout and configuration but the dimensions were landscape, so padding calculations went crazy. Nova detects and throws out these bad measurements.* On ICS creating hardware layers in some circumstances was like 5x slower on the sgs2 with ICS than the Galaxy Nexus, basically the same hardware. Nova needed to create them for folder animations and would cut half the animation if it was taking too long.* On some devices they expose a Bluetooth settings shortcut, for example so an app could ask the user to turn on Bluetooth without requiring the permission. But then in a system update they required the permission to launch the shortcut. Nova users already had it on the desktop and suddenly it stops working (and works in launchers that request every permission). Fortunately for me they had a bug in their settings app that let me bypass the permission check anyway.* Their ""App Optimizer"" breaks background notification listeners like teslaunread. I don't have a hacky workaround for that yet but am dreaming up some.* They broke the unofficial expand notification shade api, this I can't completely blame them as its unofficial. But its frustrating as Nova needs users to enable accessibility now for an alternative api.Ideally a developer should be able to make a good app by just building against the emulator or a Nexus device. But in practice you need to test heavily against Samsung and each of their system updates as you never know what will work and what won't. That said, I have hacks to work around bugs in HTC, LG, Moto, Huawei, and even smaller oems like Alcatel and LeTv too. Samsung is the biggest OEM by far, so we hear and care about bugs there more often than other oems. ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7084,camera,"**Features*** This release introduces a set of new camera change listeners for camera motion start, ongoing, and end events. You can also see why the camera is moving, whether it's caused by user gestures, built-in API animations or developer-controlled movements. Below is a summary of the new listeners. For details, see the guide to camera change events. (Issue 4636)* The onCameraMoveStarted() callback of the OnCameraMoveStartedListener is invoked when the camera starts moving. The callback method receives a reason for the camera motion.* The onCameraMove() callback of the OnCameraMoveListener is invoked multiple times while the camera is moving or the user is interacting with the touch screen.* The OnCameraIdle() callback of the OnCameraIdleListener is invoked when the camera stops moving and the user has stopped interacting with the map.* The OnCameraMoveCanceled() callback of the OnCameraMoveCanceledListener is invoked when the current camera movement has been interrupted.* You can store an arbitrary data object with a marker using Marker.setTag(), and retrieve the data object using Marker.getTag(). For details, see the guide to associating data with a marker. (Issue 4650)* With GoogleMap.setMinZoomPreference() and GoogleMap.setMaxZoomPreference() you can set a prefered minimum and/or maximum zoom level. This is useful, for example, if your app shows a defined area around a point of interest, or if you're using a custom tile overlay with a limited set of zoom levels. For details, see the guide to setting minimum/maximum zoom preferences. (Issue 4663)* With GoogleMap.setLatLngBoundsForCameraTarget(), you can constrain the lat/lng centre bounds of the focal point of the map (the camera target) so that users can only scroll and pan within these bounds. For example, a retail app for a shopping centre or airport may want to constrain the map to a particular bounds, allowing users to scroll and pan within those bounds. For details, see the guide to restricting the user's panning to a given area.**Resolved Issues*** Marker icon anchor breaks with Google Play services 9.0.83. (Issue 9768)* ActivityNotFoundException when Google Map is uninstalled/deactivated.

Those apps probably target an older SDK version so they're granted permissions automatically. However, you can still revoke them - just go into the settings app and try turning off permissions for some apps - fun things will happen.If you want to target an older Android version, go to your build.gradle file (the one that shows Module: app), and change the *targetSdkVersion* to 22 or lower.

2168,camera,"Why does the ""Source Crop"" for my Camera2 preview SurfaceView keep changing when nothing else does?:This follows on from a previous conversation about  why my camera preview changes proportions after rotation \- I think I now *sort of*  know why it does, but what I don't know is what the blinking flip I need to do about it.Basically I have a CameraPreview that selects the closest available image size to the available space on the view and picks the correct size to match it. You might imagine that the CameraPreview looks a bit like this:   **private void** createCameraPreviewSession() {**try** {mSurfaceView.getHolder().setFixedSize(width, height);Surface surface = **mSurfaceView**.getHolder().getSurface();  **mPreviewRequestBuilder** = **mCameraDevice**.createCaptureRequest(CameraDevice.***TEMPLATE\_PREVIEW***);  **mPreviewRequestBuilder**.addTarget(surface);  **if** (**mCameraDevice** != **null** &amp;&amp; **mImageReader** != **null** &amp;&amp; **fragmentState** == ***CONNECTING\_CAMERA***) {    **mCameraDevice**.createCaptureSession(Arrays.*asList*(surface), createStateCallback(), **null**);  } **else** {  }  } **catch** (CameraAccessException e) {  Log.*w*(***TAG***, **""Access exception during CaptureSession initialisation: ""** \+ e.getMessage());  Log.*getStackTraceString*(e);  }}On the current test device, the width and height are 1280x720 or 720x1280 depending on orientation. The weird part is that when I first open the activity that uses this preview, the camera view is distorted. When I rotate it, it stays distorted, when I rotate it back, it looks fine and the proportions generally, but not always, stay alright after that first rotation.After a lot of poking around I have finally discovered the *dumpsys SurfaceFlinger* command, which allows me to see the details of my surface, and that gives me some new information. When the view is bad it looks like this:  `-------------------------------------------------------------------------------`   `Layer name`  `Z |  Comp Type |   Disp Frame (LTRB) |          Source Crop (LTRB)`  `-------------------------------------------------------------------------------`   `SurfaceView - com.myApp/com.myApp.CameraActivity#0`    `4294967294 |     Device |    0    0  720 1229 |   39.0    0.0  960.0  720.0`  `- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -`   `com.myApp/com.myApp.CameraActivity#0`  `21055 |     Device |    0   20  720 1280 |    0.0   20.0  720.0 1280.0`  `- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -`But when it is good it looks like this: `-------------------------------------------------------------------------------`   `Layer name`  `Z |  Comp Type |   Disp Frame (LTRB) |          Source Crop (LTRB)`  `-------------------------------------------------------------------------------`   `SurfaceView - com.myApp/com.myApp.CameraActivity#0`    `4294967294 |     Device |    0    0  720 1184 |    0.0    0.0 1280.0  720.0`  `- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -`  `com.myApp/com.myApp.CameraActivity#0`  `21055 |     Device |    0   20  720 1280 |    0.0   20.0  720.0 1280.0`  `- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -`Clearly the Source Crop is being set completely differently in both cases - but can anyone tell me why? Where does the Source Crop come from and how can I change it? If I can't change it, is there a way to find what the Source Crop is set to for my surface? If I know that I should be able to find a way to compensate for the disparity.&amp;#x200B;",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perhaps Maps is expensive, but ever think about all the work it takes them to maintain it?

You can explain why you need this permission, and why it is necessary. If a camera app asks me for the camera permission and maybe even explains why it needs it (duh) I would never give it a one star review for doing so.  If you can't explain it there wouldn't be a reason to ask for it. The same applies if it isn't necessary.Usually permissions are only needed for a small part of the app. Only IFF I want to use that feature should I be prompted for the permission. If I deny it I can't use that one feature. Yet some apps will prompt for permissions on a _splash screen_ and require them to proceed. I will usually rate those apps one star as well.Very few apps will actually require a permission to even deliver a single feature (e.g. cameras without camera permission) If I don't grant the permission there should be some UI explaining why it is needed.Apps use _way_ too many permissions and it's the worst anti pattern. Selecting a profile image should neither require camera, nor external storage, yet a lot of apps will _require_ those permissions to do so. If I want my apps to collect all permissions I'll buy an iPhone instead.I don't know what your app does but I do know that 1 star reviews like the one are often well justified.PS: I do hope Google's bot detection is a bit better than _rates mostly x stars_ ;)",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
897,email address,"As an Android developer AND user having your developer account terminated is devastating.:I am coming to terms with the reality that I am no longer allowed to be a Google user, and it's depressing to say the very least.I got an email last week letting me know that my Google Wallet card had been suspended due to fraud prevention and that I needed to verify personal information. I sent them a scan of my driver's license and my associated debit card, and received a response that my information could not be verified. I tried to verify again, this time with a bank account statement and my credit card. Again, my account could not be verified. I called Google Wallet support and sat on hold with a representative for 30 minutes while he tried to verify my account, but it could not be verified. He recommended that I contact developer support as it may be part of my Developer account.I contacted developer support and, while they didn't mention a specific reason, they suggested that I file an appeal as my account may have been terminated due to ""violations by associated developer accounts."" I filed an appeal and was denied -immediately- due to ""multiple policy violations by this or associated accounts"". I was also instructed to not start another account as it would be suspended as well and all funds forfeit. I was told to refer to the emails I received with the subject REASON FOR REMOVAL, however I never received any emails. I was able to eventually isolated the issue as to why my account was terminated: a developer I had worked with in the past, who was still associated with my account, HAD had their account terminated, but not for apps associated with my account, nor had that developer released any apps on my account at all. They were simply associated with my account as a developer. (Not an owner or administrator). I imagine this was Google removing any means of this developer releasing an app, but I would've hoped terminating *their* account would've accomplished there.How bad is the termination? The termination comes along with suspending my Google Wallet account, which can also not be re-opened. Not by my real name, bank account, email address, or credit card. This means that Google will literally no longer accept money from me for any reason. My Google Drive subscription lapsed today and can not be renewed. My Google Music subscription will lapse at the end of the month and can not be renewed. I got into the Google Domains beta and I'm lucky I didn't transfer any domains to them because I likely wouldn't have been able to pay for those as well. I can no longer purchase ANYTHING from the Play store; Not music, not movies, not apps, and not even devices like Glass. I can no longer purchase micro-transactions in the apps I already own. I can never make an NFC payment again.At this point, literally, my only option to be able to continue as a mobile user and developer is to commit completely to iOS. I have to buy an iPhone*. I have to find a new music subscription service. I have to purchase music and videos either through iTunes or Amazon.Worst of all, my story is not the only one. The internet is full of stories of users who have been terminated for reason they can not entirely understand. A termination from being an Android Developer is a termination from being a Google user and you are automatically guilty by association even if you have violated no policies yourself.I am not happy to say the very least.tl;dr: Termination of your developer account also permanently suspends your Google Wallet.*Addendum: After further research I could probably use the Amazon app store, something like rdio or Spotify for music, and Dropbox or Skydrive for a Drive replacement, but I'd just really rather not have to do any of that.

4319,IP address,"Maybe I should have explained that better, but I was out with friends and get yelled at by some of them for being anti social if I tried to type all of this out. Okay, we deal with a couple of things. Number one though, for example I used action bar Sherlock on one project, and the boss thought it was inconsistent with android design, but more importantly all other apps that we had. Doesn't make a shit load of sense, but I don't get to make that decision. Secondly, anything I write for android has to completely match the iOS app flow, which sucks. So say in our LanScan that's not out yet, I have to be able to take it to our airport and run through ~7k addresses or so in about 30 seconds. Not only that, but my adapters and control over particular cells in the UI thread is pretty heavy duty since one cell is constantly being updated with a progress dialog, read out of the most recently found node, what kind of scan I am doing (""bonjour, NetBios, ping, port, native, arp, etc""), and in the meantime of all of that, it has to be able to sort the result cells by IP address, pull forward any settings (like name and vendor) from the database, oh and the worst part... Quit the test and restart one in less than 2 seconds. That means my thread control has to be pretty picky with consistently check interruptions (which only act as flags by the way, not a variable, meaning if the thread somehow survives the interruption for whatever reason, it no longer thinks it's being interrupted). A lot of libraries are really bad about those things, and incredibly wasteful with resources, if they even exist. Thirdly, the library we use was actually written by me and translated from The original, which was in C. That library is actually proprietary to the point that McAfee purchased the rights to include certain parts in their security software for multiple millions. It does things like network packet intrusion detection, geographical traceroutes, device detection, etc. Some of our other work has been consulting for companies that are publicly traded and their stuff is rather proprietary and very specific in the server process of what it expects on login, notification of upcoming tasks, etc, and again nothing really does that. Even if it did, we don't have a legal department, and have to make absolutely sure that we don't expose them to any issues. With some of their profiles, it also means that acknowledgement of using open source is not going to happen, so lose that option there. So while I wish I was doing simple things, I really don't get to. We had a project break last week, and me and the boss each wrote a coin converter for crypto currencies. That was fun, and I actually did get to use some libraries that made it really easy. So basically, no, most of the stuff I do doesn't exist in anything open source, and if it does, I won't get to use it for one of many reasons. Also, boss wrote the compression algorithms for the original zip file, while Phil Katz wrote the self extractor. Needless to say, when your shit doesn't stink.... Your opinion is the only one who's matters. ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5454,location,"You just have to explain it to them. There are amazing iOS apps that if ported 100% to Android, would be terrible apps (and vice versa). Every app must take into account the uniqueness that comes with the platform.The reason it is so important to make use of platform design standards is that you can build an instantly familiar UI by re-using familiar design components. This drastically lowers the learning curve when a user first opens the app. Most Android users are familiar with the hamburger navigation and how it works. You tap the hamburger icon, and out pops a menu that overlays your content. If I saw a menu that pushed my content to the left - it would make me uncomfortable, because I am not used to that.By re-using familiar design components, you get the UI out of the way. When users do not notice your UI design choices, it's a good thing.Let's say you drive a car that has the parking brake near the center console. This is what you are used to. Imagine you got into your friends car, and the parking brake is in a different location. Maybe under the steering wheel, or a button on the door. You would be annoyed, because you cannot find it immediately, because it is not where you'd expect. When designing a UI, do not force the user to learn something new when you do not have to. As material design proliferates, more users will come to expect it. By designing your app based on material design - you are making it easier for your users to navigate around your app.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8101,location,"Hi GrandAdmiralDan,Well, I’m happy to hear you guys are working on this. And I’m really happy to hear ICU will become public API.But frankly, considering we are 8 years into Android and you are only starting to fix this now, still doesn’t really reflect well. I know it is easy to workaround the NDK to get Lua built, but for my time constraints and audience background, it is reflective of the types of problems we developers still fight on a regular basis. Lua is the easiest to deal with, but there are many more which are much more painful and time consuming. I could have gotten into how the newer NDK API levels removed a few things which prevented ICU from building. Or the problems and bugs I encountered trying to build Swift on Android with different API versions. Or I could have gotten into other never fixed roadblocking bugs like the infamous bug 3434. And I didn’t talk about Android fragmentation and the fact is that over 1/4 is still pre-API 21. (And a stdio deadlocking bug in 5.0 which affects Swift so 5.1 is the minimum instead of 5.0, losing nearly another 10% of the current available devices.) Even with your changes that may be coming in a few years, we still have to add extra years on top of that before we can use them.But here’s a another problem I’m facing maybe you can help with. As I said in the talk, I am adding CMake support for Swift. I also said Android is officially adding CMake support. However, for time, what I did not say is that there is a new hell that has been created because there are now 3 major CMake toolchains now competing with each other, and all are incompatible. There is the OpenCV toolchain which everybody has forked from for the past many years (including me), the official CMake just added Android support, and you guys have your own fork which is incompatible with both of them and is stuck on an old CMake 3.6 (CMake is now on 3.8).I just posted to the NDK mailing list asking about how I can leverage yours, but I need to be able to merge in my changes and invoke CMake sitting in a different location than yours. But so far, the answer seems to be that I can’t do this, and your CMake source is not something I can pull and merge with. But no answer from the person who would know for sure. Maybe you can find out how to make this possible get your CMake git repo published.I also want to point out that I’m am seriously disappointed that you guys didn’t add Android Studio project generation to your CMake implementation, so you still need to have both an Android Studio project and a CMake description. (And I am still uncovering a lot of limitations.) This is just one more of those time sucking things that makes it so unpleasant to support Android. This is one of things I implemented for Blurrr to solve for other people, but is a PITA to maintain. You guys implementing this, maintaining it, and contributing it back to CMake would be actually really valuable to the world.One more thing. As you fix the C++ side of the NDK, please don’t forget C. Maybe it’s just me, but I’m getting this overall vibe that the NDK team may still be thinking of C support as a second class citizen. I’m seeing this in Android Studio as there are things explicitly labeled C++, even when I’m only dealing with C. Back to the one of the premises of the talk, C is one of the most important foundational things that everything else can stand on.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For obtaining the location, as somebody already said, you need the Location API only.

Seeing this is an educational project free to use, i believe that restriction doesn't apply to you. (See Google Maps Terms Section 10.4.c.iv) But my advice to you would be to track the user positions on the phone and build a .KML file of the ""recording"" session. This file can later be uploaded to a server when a data connection is available or shared to your contacts via intents through mail, instant messaging or whatever. Then, the user contacts or the user himself can load this kml on Google Earth or Google My Maps to see the location path.

1504,location,"Looking for advice on how to integrate Google Play Services location SettingsAPI with MVP architecture:Hey /r/androiddev,I have an MVP architecture app that utilizes Google Play Services, Dagger 2, and RxJava but I'm having a hard time integrating Google's APIs into MVP. It seems like many of Google's APIs lend themselves to tons of logic inside of Activities (Which goes against single responsibility principle and MVP).I have a screen that needs to access the phone's location so I'm checking if location settings are enabled in my presenter. To do this, I've written a reactive wrapper around Google Play Services Location so my presenter delegates to `LocationInteractor` which calls into Google Play Services.To check if location settings are enabled you need to call into Google's SettingsAPI,  jump through a ton of hoops and callbacks, and eventually get back a `LocationSettingsResult` object. Fine. To get the status of the settings you need to call `locationSettingsResult.getStatus()` and check if the `status.getStatusCode()` is equal to either `LocationSettingsStatusCodes.SUCCESS`, `LocationSettingsStatusCodes.RESOLUTION_REQUIRED`, or `LocationSettingsStatusCodes.SETTINGS_CHANGE_UNAVAILABLE`. If the status code is `RESOLUTION_REQUIRED`, then calling `status.startResolutionForResult(Activity activity, int requestCode)` will open this wonderful dialog prompting the user to enable location services. Ok. So my `LocationInteractor` takes care of this and returns a `Status` object from Google Play Services:`public Single&lt;Status&gt; getLocationSettingStatus(){...}`All fine and dandy. Since opening this dialog requires an Activity, I'm having my presenter call back to the view with this `Status` object:        // Inside of some presenter method    locationInteractor.getLocationSettingStatus()                            .subscribe(status -&gt; {                                if (status.getStatusCode() == LocationSettingsStatusCodes.SUCCESS) {                                    doSomethingThatRequiresLocation();                                } else if (status.getStatusCode() == LocationSettingsStatusCodes.RESOLUTION_REQUIRED) {                                    if (isViewAttached()) {                                        view.showDialog(status);                                    }                                } else {                                    if (isViewAttached()) {                                        view.onErrorNoLocation();                                    }                                }                            }, throwable -&gt; {                                if (isViewAttached()) {                                    view.onErrorNoLocation();                                }                            });The View's `showDialog` method looks like this:    @Override        public void showDialog(Status status) {            try {                status.startResolutionForResult(this, 0);            } catch (IntentSender.SendIntentException e) {                onErrorLocation();            }        }However, this still isn't enough! You need to catch the result of this dialog in `onActivityResult`!!     @Override        public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);            switch (requestCode) {                case 0:                    switch (resultCode) {                        case Activity.RESULT_OK:                            // Call to presenter                            // Location settings now enabled                            break;                            case Activity.RESULT_CANCELED:                            // Location settings still disabled                            onErrorLocation();                            break;                    }                    break;            }        }I really really hate all this boilerplate. Every place that I want to check for location settings I am going to need to add this boilerplate in my presenter and views. This is a lot of code to be copying around! Furthermore, the `Status` object is final which makes it super hard to mock it during tests of my presenter.  Does anyone know a better way of interacting with this API in an MVP context?Although I really love how this dialog window will automatically enable location services, I am thinking about ditching Google's SettingsAPI since it is such a PITA to use. I'd rather open a custom dialog that has a button which opens the phone location settings. It won't be automatic like the SettingsAPI, but it will fit into my architecture, be easier to use, and be easy to test.**Should I deal with all this Google Play Services boilerplate or just roll my own dialog which will obey MVP principles?**Sorry for the wall of text I really needed to rant about this API. ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't consider it suitable for regular users, though, just power users. On stock Android it takes the user to a screen listing apps that are currently excluded from power saver; the user has to find the option to show all apps on the device, and then sift through the list of 100\+ more\-or\-less obscure apps to find the desired app. This won't work for a majority of users IMO.I wonder if that kind of watchdog that you mention can be made reliable.

Consent is required for when you need to process data which is not absolutely required for your app to work \(so for crash reports, if location is optional and so on\).  \(Think about a bank, they also have to comply with GDPR \- I cannot go to my bank and tell them that I no longer want them to process my personal data \- they need this in order to function.  But, they need to limit the data they are processing.\)I don't think your suggestion is viable since each developer using AdMob might use different providers.  Remember, GDPR requires you to tell your users where the data is going and what it is used for.  This is different for each developer and you really need to consider other consent too \(more important than AdMob is obtaining consent for grabbing crash reports as that is entirely optional in operation of most apps!\).",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1943,location,"Background processing:I am developing an app and came to a point where I need to do some heavy work in the background. I found my self in two differente scenarios where I see this is needed:1. My app manages a set of data and there is an import section that can potentially take long to execute, since for every entry a different rest request needs to be performed. So I though about doing this the same way imgur does with image uploading: Triggering some kind of background execution that displays its progress in a notification and lets you know when its done. You can still use the app in the meantime and if you go to the import section you can also see the progress of the task being executed.2. I need to know the location of the user (provided they gave permission) in many points through the app. I got a library that handles location requests through RxJava and it works nicely, also lets me subscribe to periodic updates in the form of an Observable. However this means i need to subscribe again from every activity / screen. So i thought maybe there is a way to request updates constantly while the app is open and launch a broadcast message to whoever is listening to let them know of the new data. I started digging up a bit online to see how to accomplish these two tasks but I got quickly overwhelmed by old and new documentation talking about many different solutions such as JobIntents, JobSchedulers, Services, Background &amp; Foreground Services, IntentServices, WorkManagers, AlarmManagers... Can you give me some guidance here please?",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When a user logs in, I create a new *User* object, convert it to JSONObject and then save the JSON to SharedPreferences using SharedManager. Then whenever I need to check if a user is logged in, I simply call SharedManager.getUserAccount(context) and this method checks the SharedPreferences if the user is saved.4. When the user logs out, I simply clear SharedPreferences.The thing that I'm worried about is the fact that I'm saving user's password to SharedPreferences.

9965,voice,"Android is probably one of the most blood bathed areas of non scientific development. Api's move fast, every component Google gives you is the most bare bone possible in existence, java will make you pull out your hair. You will find tutorials but you might not be able to find what you need due to old Api's.Everything will move in stages of 1 year at minimum, you will have to be ready to update yourself (as any development specialization, but this time to ease development).But in the end, after some time you will be able to design and implement apps as if you were hearing god's voice.Do not be afraid, nobody is perfect, nobody in the industry knows where is heading to, there is more shitty code in the wild that we want to admit. And the best two virtues you should master is: learn how to search your problems and knowledge when you need to ask for help.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
